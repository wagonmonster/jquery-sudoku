## Synopsis

A Sudoku game built with HTML, CSS & jQuery.

Ironically, I knew nothing about the game of Sudoku before building this, I think it took me almost as long to learn the game as it did to code this.

As you can see, it's pre-populated with a static set of numbers, I plan on making a new game generator in the futire.


## Motivation

Code Test for a Job Interview

## Installation

Nothing needed, just a web browser and an internet connection.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Feel free to build a board generator, if you'd like.
